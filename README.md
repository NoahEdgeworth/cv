# Personal Website

Hello! Welcome to my personal website v1!
This is my first attempt at a personal website after learning some basic HTML and CSS.
I plan on updating my site as my skills advance, and I gain more knowledge on web development.

In future updates I would like to add:
  1) Animated visuals
  2) Use more complex CSS properties
